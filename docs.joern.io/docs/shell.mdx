title: Interactive Shell
---

Joern provides an interactive shell for code analysis, much like an
operating system shell. We base this shell on the popular Scala shell
[Ammonite](https://ammonite.io/#Features). In summary, the shell offers
the following major features:

* Tab-completion
* GNU readline support for line editing
* JSON output
* Pipe operators
* Inline code browsing with a pager
* Dynamic library import


## Launching the Interactive Shell

The shell can be started by issuing the following command:

```
$ joern
```

## Basic Keyboard Commands

The Joern underlying shell is essentially an interactive Scala shell that supports the following keyboard commands:

| **Command** | **Description** |
| - | - |
| CTRL-c | Cancels current operation/clears shell. Does *not* quit Joern |
| CTRL-d | Quits Joern (shell must be clear) |
| TAB | Autocomplete |
| UP | Moves through command history |
| CTRL-LEFT/RIGHT | Step through commands word-by-word (instead of character-by-character) |
| CTRL-r | Searches command history. Use CTRL-r (or UP/DOWN) to cycle through your matches |

## Exporting Results with Pipe Operators and `toJson`

The execution directive (see [Traversal
Basics](/traversal-basics)) `toJson` can be used at the end of
queries in order to convert results into the JSON format. This feature can
be combined with the shell's pipe operators to write results out to
the file system. For example,

```java
cpg.method.toJson |> "/tmp/foo.json"
```

writes all methods nodes into the file `/tmp/foo.json`.


## Inline Code Browsing

For an increasing number of languages, the Joern shell allows you to
read code associated with query results directly on the shell. For
example, to review all calls to `memcpy`, you can issue:

```java
joern> cpg.method.name("memcpy").callIn.code.l

res5: List[String] = List(
  "memcpy(buf, first, first_len)",
  "memcpy(buf + first_len, second, second_len)",
  "memcpy(buf, first, first_len)",
  "memcpy(buf + first_len, second, second_len)",
  "memcpy(buf + first_len, second, second_len)",
  "memcpy(buf, first, first_len)"
)
```

You can also pipe the result list into a pager as follows:

```java
joern> browse(cpg.method.name("memcpy").callIn.code.l)
```


To study the context in which a result occurs, you can use the .dump
method, which will dump the enclosing functionâ€™s code for each
finding, and point you to the finding via an arrow:

```c
joern> cpg.method.name("memcpy").callIn.dump

int main() {
  unsigned int first_len = UINT_MAX - 256;
  unsigned int second_len = 256;
  unsigned int buf_len = 256;

  char first[first_len], second[second_len], buf[buf_len];
  int new_len = (first_len+second_len); // <- IDB (negative)

  if(new_len <= 256) {
	memcpy(buf, first, first_len);
        memcpy(buf + first_len, second, second_len); /* <=== */
  }
}

...
```
You can use this feature together with browse to read code in the
pager. Finally, if you want to read the code in your editor of choice,
just dump it to a file:

```bash
cpg.method.name("memcpy").callIn.dumpRaw |> "/tmp/foo.c"
```

We use `dumpRaw` here to skip syntax highlighting, as your editor will
most likely do that for you.

:::note
Please make sure
[source-highlight](https://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/) is
installed for the `.dump` feature to work.

### Dynamically Importing Additional Scripts

You can dynamically load additional scripts at any time.

As an example, let's assume there's a file called `MyScript.sc` that contains only `val elite = 31337`. You can import the script as follows:

```java
import $file.MyScript
MyScript.elite
res1: Int = 31337
```

If the file is in a subfolder (e.g. **scripts**), use dot syntax: `import $file.scripts.MyScript`.

To go up one directory, use `^`.

### Adding Dependencies to the JVM `classpath` Dynamically

```java
// java dependency
import $ivy.`com.michaelpollmeier:versionsort:1.0.1`
versionsort.VersionHelper.compare("2.1.0", "2.0.10")
// res: Int = 1

// scala dependency
import $ivy.`com.michaelpollmeier::colordiff:0.9`
colordiff.ColorDiff(List("a", "b"), List("a", "bb"))
// color coded diff
```

If the dependencies are not on Maven Central, you can add a resolver:

```java
interp.repositories() ++= Seq(coursierapi.MavenRepository.of("https://shiftleft.jfrog.io/shiftleft/libs-snapshot-local"))
```

### Measuring the Time While Running a Computation

```java
time { 
  println("long running computation")
  Thread.sleep(1000)
  42
}
// res: (42, 1000332390 nanoseconds)
```
