title: Data-Flow Steps
---

Data-Flow Steps are Complex Steps that represent flows of data.

We will look at each one using our sample program `X42`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  if (argc > 1 && strcmp(argv[1], "42") == 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "It depends!\n");
    exit(42);
  }
  printf("What is the meaning of life?\n");
  exit(0);
}
```

:::info
__NOTE:__ As of Joern v1.1.299, this is no longer required. The OSS dataflow overlay is now created
automatically during CPG generation.

After importing the program, make sure to run the OSS dataflow overlay creation command in order to run these steps:

```java
joern> run.ossdataflow 
The graph has been modified. You may want to use the `save` command to persist changes to disk.  All changes will also be saved collectively on exit
res0: Cpg = io.shiftleft.codepropertygraph.Cpg@221b5be0
```

### reachableBy

`reachableBy` is a _Data-Flow Step_ that returns sources for flows of data from sinks to sources.

```java
joern> cpg.call.name("strcmp").reachableBy(cpg.method.parameter).l
res0: List[MethodParameterIn] = List(
  MethodParameterIn(
    id -> 1000104L,
    code -> "char *argv[]",
    order -> 2,
    name -> "argv",
    evaluationStrategy -> "BY_VALUE",
    typeFullName -> "char * [ ]",
    dynamicTypeHintFullName -> List(),
    lineNumber -> Some(5),
    columnNumber -> Some(19)
  )
)
```

### reachableByFlows

`reachableByFlows` is a _Data-Flow Step_ that returns paths for flows of data from sinks to sources.

```java
joern> sink.reachableByFlows(source).l
res0: List[Path] = List(
  Path(
    List(
      MethodParameterIn(
        id -> 1000104L,
        code -> "char *argv[]",
        order -> 2,
        name -> "argv",
        evaluationStrategy -> "BY_VALUE",
        typeFullName -> "char * [ ]",
        dynamicTypeHintFullName -> List(),
        lineNumber -> Some(5),
        columnNumber -> Some(19)
      ),
      Call(
        id -> 1000112L,
        code -> "strcmp(argv[1], \"42\")",
        name -> "strcmp",
        order -> 1,
        methodInstFullName -> None,
        methodFullName -> "strcmp",
        argumentIndex -> 1,
        dispatchType -> "STATIC_DISPATCH",
        signature -> "TODO assignment signature",
        typeFullName -> "ANY",
        dynamicTypeHintFullName -> List(),
        lineNumber -> Some(6),
        columnNumber -> Some(18),
        resolved -> None,
        depthFirstOrder -> None,
        internalFlags -> None
      )
    )
  )
)
```
