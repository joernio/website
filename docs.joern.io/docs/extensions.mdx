title: Developing Plugins
---

Joern can be enhanced via plugins. Plugins can...

* ... access the Code Property Praph using the query language
and create new nodes, edges and properties via the DiffGraph
API.
* ... interface with arbitrary Java libraries to
e.g., access the filesystem or network, or data analysis capabilities.
* ... add new node and edge types can be added to the
schema, and the definition of existing node and edge types can be
modified.

In the simplest case, plugins add queries to Joern, as for example the 
`query-database` plugin does.

## Managing plugins

Plugins are  distributed as zip files containing Java archives. They
can be written in any JVM-based language, e.g., in Java, Scala, or
Kotlin.

Joern comes with a few plugins pre-installed. You can list installed
plugins using

```
joern --plugins
```

New plugins can be added:

```
joern --add-plugin <zipfile>
```

and removed:

```
joern --rm-plugin <name>
```
You can download an example plugin here for testing:

https://github.com/joernio/query-database/releases/latest/download/querydb.zip

## Developing your own plugin

We provide a sample plugin that you can use as a template. Please make sure 
the following dependencies are installed:

* OpenJDK 8 or higher
* The scala built tool (any version)

You can then install and test the sample plugin by running

```
git clone https://github.com/joernio/sample-plugin.git
cd sample-plugin
./install.sh
```

This will install `joern` in the sub directory `joern-inst` and create 
symbolic links in the working directory. Finally, it will add the sample 
plugin to the aforementioned joern installation via `joern --add-plugin`.

Now start joern:

``
./joern
``
and on the `joern` shell, type

```
run
```

You should see the sample plugin named `gitextension` in the overview

![Run output](/img/run.png)


You can inspect and modify the options of the example plugin via

```
opts.gitextension.<TAB>
```

To run the extension on the shell, type `run.gitextension`. This should 
throw an exception, indicating that no projects are loaded.

## Importing into the IntelliJ IDE and running tests

Joern plugins can be developed in an IDE and the process of
importing a plugin may differ slightly from IDE to IDE. The
following instructions are for IntelliJ 2020.1.1.

Choose "Open or Import" to import the project.

![IntelliJ start screen](/img/startscreen.png)


Next, select the directory from the file selector. Assuming that your
IntelliJ installation has support for `sbt` installed, the import is
fully automated.

![Just select the project](/img/select.png)


Finally, navigate to `src/test/scala/io/shiftleft/gitextension` and
click on `GitextentionTests`. You can right-click on the class or the
individual tests to run them.

## Building a shippable plugin

You can create a plugin ready for installation via `./joern --add-plugin` by 
running:

```
sbt createDistribution
```

## Adding dependencies

You can add dependencies by modifying the variable
`libraryDependencies` in `build.sbt`:

```
// build.sbt
name := "joern-sample-extension"
ThisBuild/organization := "io.joern"
ThisBuild/scalaVersion := "2.13.0"

...

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
   // Add your dependencies here
  "org.eclipse.jgit" % "org.eclipse.jgit" % "5.7.0.202003110725-r",
  // ...
  "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "3.1.1" % Test
)

...
```

## Extending the CPG schema

You can make additions to the CPG schema specification by placing
`.json` files in `schema/src/main/resources/schema/`. A sample schema
extension is provided that adds an edge of type "FOO" that is valid
from `FILE` nodes to `METHOD` nodes.


```
schema/src/main/resources/schema/ext.json

{
  "edgeTypes" : [
    {"id" : 9000, "name": "FOO", "comment" : "Foo edge", "keys": []}
  ],

  "nodeTypes" : [
      { "name" : "FILE", "outEdges" : [{"edgeName": "FOO", "inNodes": [{"name": "METHOD"}]}] }
  ]
}

```
