The Joern project is the original implementation of [Code Property Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_property_graph), based on the 2014 IEEE Security & Privacy paper [Modeling and Discovering Vulnerabilities with Code Property Graphs](https://fabianyamaguchi.com/files/2014-ieeesp.pdf), making the representation accessible to the broader research community and accelerating innovation in automated vulnerability discovery. Honoring its long lasting impact, the paper received the IEEE Test-of-Time Award in 2024.

This page provides an overview of research and applications that employ Joern. If you would like your work to be featured on this page, please feel free to [reach out](mailto:contact@whirlylabs.com).
